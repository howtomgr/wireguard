  "description": "WireGuard is a free and open-source VPN protocol and software implementation that aims to be simpler, faster, and more secure than existing VPN protocols. Originally developed by Jason A. Donenfeld, WireGuard provides state-of-the-art cryptography and minimal attack surface. It serves as a modern FOSS alternative to proprietary VPN solutions like Cisco AnyConnect, Palo Alto GlobalProtect, or commercial VPN services, offering enterprise-grade security with significantly better performance and a fraction of the codebase.",
